# What is an IP Address?

An **IP Address** (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique identifier for a device on a network.  
It looks something like:


### What will happen?
- **Your blog UI** will render all this with proper headings, code styling, and links (because youâ€™re using `MDXRemote` + Tailwind Typography).
- Code blocks will be styled automatically.
- Headings will be nicely spaced.


If you want, I can make this **IP Address section** look even more professional with icons, callout boxes, and syntax-highlighted code directly in your MDX. That way your blog posts will look like a premium tech blog.
